/* 

The year is 2232.

Corporations have displaced world governments to become the primary organizations of power.

People say "Have a WalMart-ful day" unironically. Truly a wasteland.

You are a data sifter. You eke out an existence by selling bundled personal information siphoned off of the global IntraNet through nefarious means. It is not a glamorous life, but it is better than being an Amazon Fresh sponsored influencer making TikTok videos promoting Pink Sauce v3.4. Unless you'd prefer that. If you do, that's weird bro, just do the problems.

You've just received your latest collection of data, and a set of orders to fulfill. Get it done.

The data you're working with will look like this:

{
    id: Number
    first_name: String
    last_name: String
    email: String
    gender: String
    ip_address: String
    credit_card: {
        number: String,
        type: String,
    },
    username: String,
    employer: String,
}
